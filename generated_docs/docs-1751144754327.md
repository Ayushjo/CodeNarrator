## userController.js

**File Path:** `parsed_code\1751144728096\controllers\userController.js`

## `getUser` Function

### Purpose
The `getUser` function is a server-side function that retrieves user information and sends it back as a JSON response.

### Functionality
When the `getUser` function is called, it creates a JSON object with a `name` and `email` property, and sends this object back as the response to the client.

### Parameters and Return Values
**Parameters:**
- `req` (object): The HTTP request object, containing information about the incoming request.
- `res` (object): The HTTP response object, used to send the response back to the client.

**Return Value:**
The function does not return a value directly. Instead, it sends the user information as a JSON response using the `res.json()` method.

### Example Usage
Here's an example of how the `getUser` function can be used in a server-side route:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/user', exports.getUser);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, when a client makes a GET request to the `/user` endpoint, the `getUser` function will be called, and the server will respond with a JSON object containing the user's name and email.

### Dependencies
The `getUser` function does not have any external dependencies. It is a standalone function that can be used within a server-side application.

# Express.js Server Boilerplate

## Purpose

This code sets up a basic Express.js server that serves an API endpoint. The server listens on port 3000 and routes all requests to the `/api` endpoint to a separate module containing the API routes.

## Functionality

1. The code imports the `express` library and creates an Express application instance.
2. It then imports a module called `apiRoutes` which likely contains the routes and handlers for the API.
3. The `app.use('/api', apiRoutes)` line mounts the API routes at the `/api` endpoint.
4. Finally, the server is started and listens on port 3000, logging a message to the console when it's ready to accept requests.

## Parameters and Return Values

This code does not take any parameters and does not return any values. It simply sets up the server and starts listening for incoming requests.

## Example Usage

To use this code, you would typically have the following files and structure:

```
- index.js (this file)
- routes/
  - api.js
```

The `api.js` file would contain the actual API routes and handlers, which would then be imported and mounted in the `index.js` file.

Here's an example of what the `api.js` file might look like:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello, world!' });
});

module.exports = router;
```

With this setup, when a client makes a request to `http://localhost:3000/api/hello`, the server would respond with a JSON object containing the message `"Hello, world!"`.

## Dependencies

This code requires the following dependencies:

- `express`: A popular web application framework for Node.js, used to create the server and handle routing.

To install the required dependencies, you can run the following command in your project directory:

```
npm install express
```

## User.js

**File Path:** `parsed_code\1751144728096\models\User.js`

# User Class

## Purpose

The `User` class is a simple representation of a user object, with properties for the user's name and email address.

## Functionality

The `User` class has the following functionality:

- **Constructor**: The `constructor` method initializes a new `User` instance with the provided `name` and `email` parameters.
- **Properties**: The `User` class has two properties, `name` and `email`, which store the user's name and email address, respectively.

## Parameters and Return Values

### Constructor

**Parameters**:
- `name` (string): The user's name.
- `email` (string): The user's email address.

**Return Value**: A new `User` instance.

## Example Usage

```javascript
const user = new User('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');
console.log(user.name); // Output: 'John Doe'
console.log(user.email); // Output: 'john.doe@example.com'
```

## Dependencies

This `User` class does not have any external dependencies. It can be used standalone in a JavaScript or TypeScript project.

# Express.js User API Endpoint

## Purpose
This code sets up an Express.js router that provides a single API endpoint for retrieving user information. The endpoint is located at the `/user` path and uses the `getUser` function from the `userController` module to handle the request.

## Functionality
The `getUser` function is responsible for retrieving user data and sending it as the response to the client. The implementation of this function is not provided in the given code, but it is expected to handle the logic for fetching and returning user data.

## Parameters and Return Values
The `getUser` function is called when a `GET` request is made to the `/user` endpoint. It does not take any parameters, and its return value is expected to be the user data that will be sent as the response.

## Example Usage
Here's an example of how you might use this API endpoint:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const userRouter = require('./routes/userRouter');

app.use('/api', userRouter);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, the `userRouter` is mounted on the `/api` path, so the `/user` endpoint would be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/api/user`.

## Dependencies
This code relies on the following dependencies:

- `express`: A popular web application framework for Node.js, used for setting up the server and routing.
- `../controllers/userController`: A module that exports the `getUser` function, which is responsible for handling the user data retrieval logic.
