Here's the documentation for the provided JavaScript/TypeScript code:

# Connecting to a MongoDB Database using Mongoose

## Purpose
The purpose of this code is to establish a connection between a JavaScript/TypeScript application and a MongoDB database using the Mongoose library.

## Functionality
The code uses the `mongoose` library to connect to a MongoDB database running on the local machine (`mongodb://localhost/testdb`). Mongoose is a popular Object Document Mapping (ODM) library that provides a high-level API for interacting with MongoDB databases.

## Parameters and Return Values
The `mongoose.connect()` method takes a single parameter:
- `"mongodb://localhost/testdb"`: A connection string that specifies the MongoDB database to connect to. In this case, it's a local database named `testdb`.

The `mongoose.connect()` method returns a `Promise` that resolves when the connection is established. If the connection fails, the `Promise` will be rejected with an error.

## Example Usage
Here's an example of how you might use this code in a larger application:

```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

// Connect to the MongoDB database
mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost/testdb")
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Connected to MongoDB");
    // Your application code goes here
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error connecting to MongoDB:", error);
  });
```

In this example, the `mongoose.connect()` method is called to establish a connection to the MongoDB database. If the connection is successful, a message is logged to the console, and the rest of the application code can be executed. If the connection fails, an error message is logged.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the `mongoose` library, which is a popular Object Document Mapping (ODM) library for MongoDB. You can install it using npm:

```
npm install mongoose
```

Once installed, you can import the `mongoose` library in your JavaScript/TypeScript code, as shown in the example above.

### authController.js

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751128060532\controllers\authController.js

Here's the documentation for the provided code:

# `login` Function

## Purpose
The `login` function is a server-side endpoint that handles user login requests. It is typically used as part of a web application's authentication system.

## Functionality
The `login` function takes an HTTP request object (`req`) and an HTTP response object (`res`) as parameters. It simply sends the string `"Login"` as the response body.

## Parameters
- `req` (object): The HTTP request object, which contains information about the incoming request, such as headers, query parameters, and request body.
- `res` (object): The HTTP response object, which is used to send the response back to the client.

## Return Value
The `login` function does not return any value. It directly sends the response using the `res.send()` method.

## Example Usage
Assuming you have a web server set up with a route for the login endpoint, you can call the `login` function like this:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.post('/login', exports.login);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, when a POST request is made to the `/login` endpoint, the `login` function will be executed, and the response will be sent with the string `"Login"`.

## Dependencies
The `login` function does not have any external dependencies. It relies on the `req` and `res` objects provided by the web framework (in this case, Express.js) to handle the HTTP request and response.

==================================================

### authMiddleware.ts

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751128060532\middleware\authMiddleware.ts

Here's the documentation for the provided code:

```typescript
/**
 * Middleware function to check if a user is authenticated.
 *
 * This middleware function is used to verify if a user is authenticated before
 * allowing them to access a protected route. In this example, the middleware
 * simply calls the `next()` function to move to the next middleware in the
 * chain, as this is a mock implementation.
 *
 * In a real-world scenario, this function would typically check for the
 * presence of a valid authentication token (e.g., a session cookie or a
 * JSON Web Token) in the request headers, and then verify the token's
 * validity before allowing the request to proceed.
 *
 * @param req - The Express request object.
 * @param res - The Express response object.
 * @param next - The Express `next()` function, which is called to pass control
 *              to the next middleware function in the stack.
 */
export function isAuthenticated(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  // mock middleware
  next();
}
```

**Purpose**:
The `isAuthenticated` function is a middleware function used to check if a user is authenticated before allowing them to access a protected route in an Express.js application.

**Functionality**:
In this example, the `isAuthenticated` function is a mock implementation that simply calls the `next()` function to move to the next middleware in the chain. In a real-world scenario, this function would typically check for the presence of a valid authentication token (e.g., a session cookie or a JSON Web Token) in the request headers, and then verify the token's validity before allowing the request to proceed.

**Parameters and Return Values**:
- `req` (Request): The Express request object.
- `res` (Response): The Express response object.
- `next` (NextFunction): The Express `next()` function, which is called to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack.

**Example Usage**:
```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { isAuthenticated } from './middleware';

const app = express();

// Apply the isAuthenticated middleware to a protected route
app.get('/protected', isAuthenticated, (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is a protected route.');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

**Dependencies**:
The `isAuthenticated` function depends on the following types from the `express` package:
- `Request`
- `Response`
- `NextFunction`

### User.ts

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751128060532\models\User.ts

Here's the documentation for the provided code:

```typescript
/**
 * User Interface
 *
 * Represents a user in the application.
 */
export interface User {
  /**
   * The unique identifier of the user.
   */
  id: string;

  /**
   * The name of the user.
   */
  name: string;

  /**
   * The email address of the user.
   */
  email: string;
}
```

**Purpose**:
The purpose of this code is to define a TypeScript interface called `User` that represents a user in the application. The interface specifies the structure of a user object, including the properties `id`, `name`, and `email`.

**Functionality**:
The `User` interface provides a standardized way to represent user data within the application. It ensures that any object that implements this interface will have the necessary properties to represent a user.

**Parameters and Return Values**:
The `User` interface does not have any parameters or return values. It is simply a type definition that describes the structure of a user object.

**Example Usage**:
Here's an example of how you can use the `User` interface:

```typescript
import { User } from './user';

const user: User = {
  id: '123456',
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
};

console.log(user.id); // Output: '123456'
console.log(user.name); // Output: 'John Doe'
console.log(user.email); // Output: 'john.doe@example.com'
```

**Dependencies**:
The `User` interface has no external dependencies. It is a standalone TypeScript type definition that can be used within the application.

# Express.js Authentication Router

## Purpose

This code defines an Express.js router for handling authentication-related routes, such as login. It utilizes the `authController` module to handle the login functionality.

## Functionality

The router defines a single route:

1. `POST /login`: This route handles the login process. It forwards the request to the `login` function in the `authController` module.

## Parameters and Return Values

### `POST /login`

**Parameters:**
- No parameters are defined in the code snippet provided.

**Return Values:**
- The return values are not explicitly defined in the code snippet, as they are handled by the `authController.login` function.

## Example Usage

To use this router, you would typically include it in your main Express.js application like this:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const authRouter = require("./routes/authRouter");

app.use("/auth", authRouter);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

In this example, all requests to the `/auth` endpoint will be handled by the `authRouter`.

## Dependencies

This code has the following dependencies:

1. `express`: The core Express.js library, used for creating the router and handling HTTP requests.
2. `../controllers/authController`: A custom module that contains the `login` function for handling the login process.

# Express.js Server with Authentication Routes

## Purpose
This code sets up a basic Express.js server with a single route for authentication-related functionality.

## Functionality
The code performs the following actions:

1. Imports the `express` library and creates an Express application instance.
2. Imports the `authRoutes` module, which likely contains the routes and logic for authentication-related functionality.
3. Mounts the `authRoutes` module on the `/api/auth` endpoint of the Express application.
4. Starts the Express server and listens for incoming requests on port `3000`.

## Parameters and Return Values
The code does not take any parameters. The `app.listen()` method returns the server instance, but this return value is not used in the provided code.

## Example Usage
To use this server, you can make HTTP requests to the `/api/auth` endpoint. For example, you might have the following routes defined in the `authRoutes` module:

```javascript
// authRoutes.js
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

router.post("/login", (req, res) => {
  // Handle user login logic
  res.json({ message: "Logged in successfully" });
});

router.post("/register", (req, res) => {
  // Handle user registration logic
  res.json({ message: "User registered successfully" });
});

module.exports = router;
```

In this case, you could make the following requests to the server:

```
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/register
```

## Dependencies
This code relies on the following dependencies:

- `express`: A popular web application framework for Node.js, used to create the server and handle routing.

Make sure to install the required dependencies by running `npm install express` in your project directory.
