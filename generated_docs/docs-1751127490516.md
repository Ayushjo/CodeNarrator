### db.js

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751127440696\config\db.js

# MongoDB Connection with Mongoose

## Purpose
This code establishes a connection to a MongoDB database using the Mongoose library, which is a popular Object Document Mapping (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

## Functionality
The code performs the following steps:

1. Imports the `mongoose` library, which is a dependency for this code.
2. Establishes a connection to a MongoDB database located at `mongodb://localhost/testdb` using the `mongoose.connect()` method.

## Parameters and Return Values
- `mongoose.connect(url, [options])`:
  - `url`: A string representing the MongoDB connection string, including the database name.
  - `options`: (Optional) An object containing additional options for the connection.
  - Returns: A `Promise` that resolves when the connection is established.

## Example Usage
```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost/myapp", {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
})
.then(() => {
  console.log("Connected to MongoDB");
})
.catch((err) => {
  console.error("Error connecting to MongoDB:", err);
});
```

In this example, the code connects to a MongoDB database named `myapp` located at `mongodb://localhost`. The `useNewUrlParser` and `useUnifiedTopology` options are used to ensure compatibility with the latest version of the MongoDB driver.

## Dependencies
- `mongoose`: A JavaScript library that provides a higher-level abstraction on top of the official MongoDB driver, making it easier to interact with MongoDB databases from a Node.js application.

### authController.js

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751127440696\controllers\authController.js

Here's the documentation for the provided JavaScript/TypeScript code:

# `login` Function

## Purpose
The `login` function is a server-side endpoint that handles user login requests. It is responsible for processing and responding to login-related requests made by clients.

## Functionality
The `login` function takes in a `req` (request) object and a `res` (response) object as parameters. It then sends the string "Login" as the response to the client.

## Parameters and Return Values
**Parameters:**
- `req` (object): The incoming HTTP request object, which contains information about the client's request, such as headers, query parameters, and request body.
- `res` (object): The HTTP response object, which is used to send a response back to the client.

**Return Value:**
The function does not return any value. It directly sends the response to the client using the `res.send()` method.

## Example Usage
Assuming you have a server-side application that uses this `login` function, you could call it like this:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.post('/login', exports.login);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, when a client makes a POST request to the `/login` endpoint, the `login` function will be executed, and the response "Login" will be sent back to the client.

## Dependencies
The provided code does not have any explicit dependencies. It assumes that the `exports` object is available, which is typically the case when the code is part of a larger module or application.

However, in a real-world application, the `login` function might depend on other modules or libraries, such as an authentication system, a database connection, or a session management mechanism. These dependencies would need to be properly imported and configured for the function to work as intended.

==================================================

### authMiddleware.ts

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751127440696\middleware\authMiddleware.ts

# Authentication Middleware

## Purpose
The `isAuthenticated` function is a middleware for an Express.js application that checks if a user is authenticated before allowing them to proceed to the next middleware function or route handler.

## Functionality
The `isAuthenticated` middleware function takes three parameters: `req` (the Express.js request object), `res` (the Express.js response object), and `next` (a function to call the next middleware function or route handler). The function currently just calls the `next()` function, which means it allows the request to proceed to the next middleware or route handler, regardless of the user's authentication status.

In a real-world application, this middleware function would typically check the user's authentication status, such as by verifying a session token or checking if the user is logged in. If the user is authenticated, the middleware would call the `next()` function to allow the request to proceed. If the user is not authenticated, the middleware could send an error response or redirect the user to a login page.

## Parameters and Return Values
**Parameters:**
- `req` (Request): The Express.js request object.
- `res` (Response): The Express.js response object.
- `next` (NextFunction): A function to call the next middleware function or route handler.

**Return Value:**
The `isAuthenticated` function does not return any value. It calls the `next()` function to allow the request to proceed to the next middleware or route handler.

## Example Usage
Here's an example of how you might use the `isAuthenticated` middleware in an Express.js application:

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { isAuthenticated } from './middleware/auth';

const app = express();

// Apply the isAuthenticated middleware to all routes
app.use(isAuthenticated);

// Define your routes and route handlers here
app.get('/protected', (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is a protected route.');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, the `isAuthenticated` middleware is applied to all routes using the `app.use()` method. This means that before any route handler is executed, the `isAuthenticated` middleware will be called to check the user's authentication status.

## Dependencies
The `isAuthenticated` function depends on the following types from the `express` package:
- `Request`
- `Response`
- `NextFunction`

==================================================

### User.ts

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751127440696\models\User.ts

Here's the documentation for the provided code:

## `User` Interface

### Purpose
The `User` interface defines the structure of a user object, which can be used throughout the application to represent a user's basic information.

### Functionality
The `User` interface has the following properties:

- `id`: a unique identifier for the user, represented as a string.
- `name`: the user's name, represented as a string.
- `email`: the user's email address, represented as a string.

### Parameters and Return Values
The `User` interface is a TypeScript type definition, and it does not have any parameters or return values. It is used to describe the shape of an object.

### Example Usage
Here's an example of how you can use the `User` interface:

```typescript
import { User } from './your-module';

const user: User = {
  id: '123456',
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
};

console.log(user.id); // Output: '123456'
console.log(user.name); // Output: 'John Doe'
console.log(user.email); // Output: 'john.doe@example.com'
```

### Dependencies
The `User` interface does not have any dependencies. It is a standalone TypeScript type definition.

==================================================

### authRoutes.js

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751127440696\routes\authRoutes.js

# Authentication Router

## Purpose
The `authRouter` module provides a router for handling authentication-related routes in an Express.js application. It defines a single route for handling user login.

## Functionality
The `authRouter` module exports an Express.js router that can be used to handle authentication-related routes. The router currently has a single route defined:

- `POST /login`: This route is handled by the `login` function from the `authController` module. This function is responsible for authenticating the user and logging them in.

## Parameters and Return Values
The `authRouter` module does not take any parameters. It exports the configured router, which can be used in the main Express.js application.

## Example Usage
To use the `authRouter` module in an Express.js application, you can import it and mount it on a specific route:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const authRouter = require("./routes/authRouter");

app.use("/auth", authRouter);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

In this example, the `authRouter` is mounted on the `/auth` route, so the login route would be accessible at `/auth/login`.

## Dependencies
The `authRouter` module has the following dependencies:

- `express`: The core Express.js library, used to create the router.
- `../controllers/authController`: The `authController` module, which provides the `login` function for handling the login route.

==================================================

### index.js

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751127440696\test-project\index.js

# Express.js Server with Authentication Routes

## Purpose
This code sets up a basic Express.js server with a single route for authentication-related functionality. The server listens on port 3000 and provides a RESTful API for handling user authentication, such as login, registration, and password reset.

## Functionality
The code performs the following tasks:

1. Imports the `express` library to create an Express.js application.
2. Creates an instance of the Express.js application and assigns it to the `app` variable.
3. Imports the `authRoutes` module, which contains the routes and handlers for authentication-related functionality.
4. Mounts the `authRoutes` middleware on the `/api/auth` path, allowing clients to access the authentication-related routes.
5. Starts the server and listens for incoming requests on port 3000, logging a message to the console when the server is running.

## Parameters and Return Values
This code does not have any direct parameters or return values. It sets up the server and mounts the authentication routes, but the actual functionality of the authentication routes is defined in the `authRoutes` module.

## Example Usage
To use this server, you would typically make HTTP requests to the `/api/auth` endpoint, such as:

```
// Login
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "example@example.com",
  "password": "mypassword"
}

// Register
POST /api/auth/register
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "example@example.com",
  "password": "mypassword"
}

// Reset Password
POST /api/auth/reset-password
{
  "email": "example@example.com"
}
```

The specific implementation of these routes and their corresponding functionality would be defined in the `authRoutes` module.

## Dependencies
This code has the following dependencies:

1. `express`: A popular web application framework for Node.js, used to create the server and handle routing.
2. `./routes/authRoutes`: A custom module that contains the routes and handlers for authentication-related functionality. This module is imported and mounted on the `/api/auth` path.

To use this code, you would need to have Node.js and the `express` library installed. You would also need to create the `authRoutes` module and place it in the `./routes` directory.

### tokenUtil.js

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751127440696\utils\tokenUtil.js

# JWT Token Generator

## Purpose
The `generateToken` function is responsible for generating a JSON Web Token (JWT) for a given user. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications, as they provide a secure way to transmit information between a client and a server.

## Functionality
The `generateToken` function takes a `user` object as input and returns a signed JWT token. The token is generated using the `jsonwebtoken` library, which is a popular library for working with JWTs in Node.js.

The function signs the token with a secret key (`"secret"`) and sets the expiration time to 1 hour (`{ expiresIn: "1h" }`). The token payload contains the user's `id` property.

## Parameters and Return Values
**Parameters:**
- `user` (object): An object representing the user for whom the token should be generated. This object must have an `id` property.

**Return Value:**
- `string`: A signed JWT token.

## Example Usage
```javascript
const { generateToken } = require('./token-generator');

const user = {
  id: 1234,
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john.doe@example.com',
};

const token = generateToken(user);
console.log(token);
// Output: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6MTIzNCwiaWF0IjoxNjIwMDAwMDAwLCJleHAiOjE2MjAwMDM2MDB9.abc123xyz456
```

## Dependencies
- `jsonwebtoken`: A library for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens.

This code assumes that you have the `jsonwebtoken` library installed in your project. You can install it using npm:

```
npm install jsonwebtoken
```
