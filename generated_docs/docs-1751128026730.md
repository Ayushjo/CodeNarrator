### userController.js

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751128000365\controllers\userController.js

Sure, here's the documentation for the provided code:

```typescript
/**
 * Retrieves user information and sends it as a JSON response.
 *
 * @param req - The HTTP request object.
 * @param res - The HTTP response object.
 * @returns void
 */
exports.getUser = (req: any, res: any) => {
  // Send a JSON response with sample user data
  res.json({ name: 'Test User', email: 'test@example.com' });
};
```

**Purpose**:
The `getUser` function is designed to retrieve user information and send it as a JSON response.

**Functionality**:
When the `getUser` function is called, it will create a JSON object with sample user data (name and email) and send it as the response to the client.

**Parameters and Return Values**:
- **Parameters**:
  - `req` (any): The HTTP request object.
  - `res` (any): The HTTP response object.
- **Return Value**: `void` - The function does not return any value, it directly sends the response.

**Example Usage**:
Assuming you have an Express.js application, you can use the `getUser` function as a route handler:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { getUser } = require('./your-module');

const app = express();

app.get('/user', getUser);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, when a client makes a GET request to the `/user` endpoint, the `getUser` function will be called, and the sample user data will be sent as a JSON response.

**Dependencies**:
The `getUser` function does not have any external dependencies. It uses the built-in functionality of the HTTP request and response objects provided by the server-side runtime (e.g., Node.js with Express.js).

### index.js

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751128000365\index.js

Sure, here's the documentation for the provided code:

# Express.js Server

## Purpose
This code sets up a basic Express.js server that serves an API. The server listens for incoming requests on port 3000 and delegates the handling of API routes to a separate module.

## Functionality
1. The `express` module is imported and an instance of the Express application is created and stored in the `app` variable.
2. The API routes are imported from the `./routes/api` module and assigned to the `apiRoutes` variable.
3. The `/api` route is configured to use the `apiRoutes` middleware, which will handle all API-related requests.
4. The server is started and listens for incoming requests on port 3000. When the server is started, a message is logged to the console.

## Parameters and Return Values
The code does not take any parameters and does not return any values. It sets up the server and starts listening for incoming requests.

## Example Usage
To use this server, you can start it by running the following command in your terminal:

```
node server.js
```

This will start the server on port 3000, and you can then make requests to the API by sending HTTP requests to `http://localhost:3000/api`.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the following modules:
- `express`: A popular web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

Make sure to install the required dependencies by running the following command in your project directory:

```
npm install express
```

### User.js

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751128000365\models\User.js

Here is the documentation for the provided JavaScript/TypeScript code:

# User Class

## Purpose

The `User` class is a simple representation of a user in an application. It encapsulates the basic information about a user, such as their name and email address.

## Functionality

The `User` class has the following functionality:

1. **Constructor**: The class has a constructor that takes two parameters, `name` and `email`, and initializes the corresponding properties of the `User` instance.
2. **Properties**: The `User` class has two properties: `name` and `email`, which store the user's name and email address, respectively.

## Parameters and Return Values

### Constructor

**Parameters**:
- `name` (string): The name of the user.
- `email` (string): The email address of the user.

**Return Value**: A new `User` instance.

## Example Usage

```javascript
// Creating a new User instance
const user = new User('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');

console.log(user.name); // Output: 'John Doe'
console.log(user.email); // Output: 'john.doe@example.com'
```

## Dependencies

This `User` class is a standalone implementation and does not have any external dependencies.

### api.js

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751128000365\routes\api.js

# User Routes

## Purpose

This module provides a set of routes for managing user-related functionality in an Express.js application.

## Functionality

The module exports a single router instance that includes the following route:

- `GET /user`: Retrieves the current user's information.

The implementation of the route is handled by the `getUser` function, which is imported from the `userController` module.

## Parameters and Return Values

### `getUser` Function

**Parameters:** None

**Return Value:** The function is expected to return an object representing the current user's information.

## Example Usage

To use the user routes, you can import the `router` instance and mount it on your Express.js application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const userRoutes = require('./routes/userRoutes');

app.use('/api', userRoutes);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, the user routes will be available under the `/api/user` endpoint.

## Dependencies

This module has the following dependencies:

- `express`: The core Express.js framework, used for creating the router instance.
- `../controllers/userController`: A module that exports the `getUser` function, which is responsible for handling the user-related logic.
