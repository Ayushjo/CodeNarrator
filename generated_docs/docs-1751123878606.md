### userController.js

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751123850036\controllers\userController.js

Here's the documentation for the provided JavaScript/TypeScript code:

```typescript
/**
 * Retrieves a user object and sends it as a JSON response.
 *
 * @param req - The HTTP request object.
 * @param res - The HTTP response object.
 * @returns The user object as a JSON response.
 */
export const getUser = (req: any, res: any): void => {
  res.json({ name: 'Test User', email: 'test@example.com' });
};
```

Purpose:
The `getUser` function is used to retrieve a user object and send it as a JSON response.

Functionality:
1. The function takes two parameters: `req` (the HTTP request object) and `res` (the HTTP response object).
2. It creates a user object with the properties `name` and `email`.
3. The function then sends the user object as a JSON response using the `res.json()` method.

Parameters:
- `req` (any): The HTTP request object.
- `res` (any): The HTTP response object.

Return Value:
The function does not return anything directly. Instead, it sends the user object as a JSON response using the `res.json()` method.

Example Usage:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { getUser } = require('./your-module');

const app = express();

app.get('/user', getUser);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, when a client makes a GET request to the `/user` endpoint, the `getUser` function will be called, and the user object will be sent as a JSON response.

Dependencies:
The provided code does not have any external dependencies. It can be used as a standalone function within a larger application or module.

### index.js

# Express.js Server Setup

## Purpose

This code sets up a basic Express.js server that listens for incoming requests on port 3000 and routes all requests starting with `/api` to the `apiRoutes` module.

## Functionality

1. The code imports the `express` module and creates an instance of the Express.js application.
2. It then imports the `apiRoutes` module, which presumably contains the routes and handlers for the API endpoints.
3. The `app.use('/api', apiRoutes)` line mounts the `apiRoutes` module on the `/api` route prefix, so that all requests to `/api/*` will be handled by the `apiRoutes` module.
4. Finally, the server is started and listening on port 3000, and a message is logged to the console when the server is ready.

## Parameters and Return Values

This code does not have any parameters or return values, as it is setting up the server and routing.

## Example Usage

To use this server, you would typically have the following setup:

1. Create an `api.js` file in the `./routes` directory, which would contain the API routes and handlers. For example:

```javascript
// ./routes/api.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello, world!' });
});

module.exports = router;
```

2. In your main server file (e.g., `server.js`), import the `apiRoutes` module and use it as shown in the provided code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const apiRoutes = require('./routes/api');

app.use('/api', apiRoutes);

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server started on port 3000'));
```

3. Run the server using a command like `node server.js`. Once the server is running, you can make requests to `http://localhost:3000/api/hello` to receive the "Hello, world!" response.

## Dependencies

This code has the following dependencies:

1. `express`: The core Express.js framework for building web applications and APIs.

To install the required dependencies, you can run the following command in your project directory:

```
npm install express
```

Here's the documentation for the provided JavaScript/TypeScript code:

```
/**
 * User Class
 *
 * Purpose:
 * The `User` class represents a user with a name and email address.
 *
 * Functionality:
 * - Constructs a new `User` object with the provided name and email.
 * - Provides access to the user's name and email properties.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * @param {string} name - The name of the user.
 * @param {string} email - The email address of the user.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * ```javascript
 * const user = new User('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');
 * console.log(user.name); // Output: 'John Doe'
 * console.log(user.email); // Output: 'john.doe@example.com'
 * ```
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - This code does not have any external dependencies.
 */
class User {
  constructor(name, email) {
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
  }
}

module.exports = User;
```

This documentation provides a clear overview of the `User` class, including its purpose, functionality, parameters, and example usage. It also mentions that the code does not have any external dependencies.

The key elements of the documentation are:

1. **Purpose**: Explains the purpose of the `User` class, which is to represent a user with a name and email address.

2. **Functionality**: Describes the functionality of the `User` class, which is to construct a new `User` object with the provided name and email, and provide access to the user's name and email properties.

3. **Parameters**: Documents the parameters of the `User` constructor, including the name and email of the user.

4. **Example Usage**: Provides an example of how to create a new `User` object and access its properties.

5. **Dependencies**: Indicates that the code does not have any external dependencies.

This documentation should help users of the `User` class understand its purpose, how to use it, and any relevant details about its implementation.

### api.js

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751123850036\routes\api.js

Here's the documentation for the provided code:

# User Route

## Purpose

The `user` route is responsible for handling HTTP GET requests to retrieve user data. It is part of a larger Express.js application and is defined using the Express Router.

## Functionality

The `user` route is set up to handle a GET request at the `/user` endpoint. When a client makes a GET request to this endpoint, the `getUser` function from the `userController` module is called to retrieve the user data.

## Parameters and Return Values

The `getUser` function, which is called when a GET request is made to the `/user` endpoint, is expected to return the user data. The function does not take any parameters.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the `user` route can be used:

```javascript
// Make a GET request to the /user endpoint
fetch('/user')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(userData => {
    console.log(userData);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching user data:', error);
  });
```

## Dependencies

The `user` route depends on the following modules:

1. `express`: The core Express.js library, used for creating the web server and router.
2. `../controllers/userController`: The `userController` module, which contains the `getUser` function responsible for retrieving the user data.
