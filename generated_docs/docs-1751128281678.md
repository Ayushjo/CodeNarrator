Certainly! Here's the documentation for the provided JavaScript/TypeScript code:

## `getUser` Function

### Purpose

The `getUser` function is a server-side endpoint that retrieves and returns a user object in JSON format.

### Functionality

The `getUser` function is an Express.js route handler that responds to an HTTP GET request. When the endpoint is accessed, the function generates a user object with a `name` and `email` property, and sends it back to the client as a JSON response.

### Parameters and Return Values

**Parameters:**
- `req` (object): The HTTP request object, which contains information about the incoming request.
- `res` (object): The HTTP response object, which is used to send the response back to the client.

**Return Value:**
The function does not return a value directly. Instead, it sends the user object as a JSON response using the `res.json()` method.

### Example Usage

Assuming you have an Express.js server set up, you can use the `getUser` function as follows:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/user', exports.getUser);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

When a client makes a GET request to the `/user` endpoint, the `getUser` function will be executed, and the client will receive the following JSON response:

```json
{
  "name": "Test User",
  "email": "test@example.com"
}
```

### Dependencies

The `getUser` function does not have any external dependencies. It is a standalone function that can be used within an Express.js application.

### index.js

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751128253867\index.js

Here's the documentation for the provided JavaScript/TypeScript code:

# Express.js Server Setup

## Purpose
This code sets up a simple Express.js server that serves an API using the provided API routes.

## Functionality
1. The code imports the `express` module and creates an Express application instance using `express()`.
2. The API routes are imported from the `./routes/api` module and mounted on the `/api` endpoint using `app.use('/api', apiRoutes)`.
3. The server starts listening on port `3000` and logs a message to the console when the server is started.

## Parameters and Return Values
The code does not take any parameters. The `app.listen()` method returns the HTTP server instance, but this return value is not used in the provided code.

## Example Usage
To use this server, you would typically have the following steps:

1. Create an `api.js` file in the `./routes` directory with the API routes:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello, world!' });
});

module.exports = router;
```

2. Create an `index.js` file (or any other entry point) with the provided code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const apiRoutes = require('./routes/api');

app.use('/api', apiRoutes);

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server started on port 3000'));
```

3. Run the server using Node.js:

```
node index.js
```

4. Access the API at `http://localhost:3000/api/hello`.

## Dependencies
This code requires the following dependencies:

- `express`: A fast, minimalist web application framework for Node.js.

Make sure to install the required dependencies by running `npm install express` before running the server.

### User.js

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751128253867\models\User.js

Sure, here's the documentation for the provided JavaScript/TypeScript code:

# User Class

## Purpose
The `User` class is a simple data structure that represents a user with a name and an email address. It can be used to store and manage user information in a JavaScript or TypeScript application.

## Functionality
The `User` class has the following functionality:

- **Constructor**: The constructor takes two parameters, `name` and `email`, and initializes the corresponding properties of the `User` object.
- **Properties**: The `User` class has two properties, `name` and `email`, which store the user's name and email address, respectively.

## Parameters and Return Values
### Constructor
- **Parameters**:
  - `name` (string): The name of the user.
  - `email` (string): The email address of the user.
- **Return Value**: A new `User` object with the specified `name` and `email`.

## Example Usage
Here's an example of how to use the `User` class:

```javascript
const User = require('./User');

const user = new User('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');
console.log(user.name); // Output: 'John Doe'
console.log(user.email); // Output: 'john.doe@example.com'
```

In this example, we first import the `User` class from the `./User` module. We then create a new `User` object with the name "John Doe" and the email address "john.doe@example.com". Finally, we log the `name` and `email` properties of the `user` object to the console.

## Dependencies
The `User` class does not have any external dependencies. It is a self-contained data structure that can be used within a JavaScript or TypeScript application.

### api.js

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751128253867\routes\api.js

# User API Endpoint

## Purpose
This code sets up an Express.js router for handling user-related API requests. It defines a single route for retrieving user information.

## Functionality
The code exports a router object that can be used to handle HTTP requests to the `/user` endpoint. When a `GET` request is made to this endpoint, the `getUser` function from the `userController` module is called to handle the request.

## Parameters and Return Values
The `getUser` function is not defined in the provided code, so its parameters and return values are not known. However, it is assumed that this function is responsible for retrieving user data and returning it as the response to the client.

## Example Usage
To use this router, you would typically import it into your main Express.js application and mount it on a specific route:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const userRouter = require('./routes/userRouter');

app.use('/api', userRouter);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, the user router is mounted on the `/api` route, so the `/user` endpoint would be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/api/user`.

## Dependencies
This code has the following dependencies:

1. **express**: The core Express.js framework, which is used to create the router and handle HTTP requests.
2. **../controllers/userController**: This is an external module that exports the `getUser` function, which is used to handle the `/user` endpoint.
