### userController.js

**File Path:** parsed_code\1751125094040\controllers\userController.js

Here's the documentation for the provided JavaScript/TypeScript code:

```typescript
/**
 * Retrieves a user's information.
 *
 * @param req - The incoming HTTP request object.
 * @param res - The HTTP response object to send the user data.
 * @returns Void - The function does not return a value, but instead sends the user data directly in the response.
 *
 * @example
 * const express = require('express');
 * const app = express();
 *
 * app.get('/user', getUser);
 *
 * app.listen(3000, () => {
 *   console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
 * });
 */
exports.getUser = (req, res) => {
  res.json({ name: 'Test User', email: 'test@example.com' });
};
```

Purpose:
The `getUser` function is responsible for retrieving a user's information and sending it as a JSON response.

Functionality:
When the `getUser` function is called, it creates a JSON object with a `name` and `email` property, and then sends this object as the response using the `res.json()` method.

Parameters and Return Values:
- `req` (object): The incoming HTTP request object.
- `res` (object): The HTTP response object used to send the user data.
- Returns: Void - The function does not return a value, but instead sends the user data directly in the response.

Example Usage:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/user', getUser);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, the `getUser` function is used as a route handler for the `/user` endpoint. When a client makes a GET request to `/user`, the `getUser` function is called, and it responds with the user data in JSON format.

Dependencies:
The `getUser` function does not have any external dependencies. It uses the built-in `res.json()` method provided by the Express.js framework to send the response.

# Express.js Server Setup

## Purpose
This code sets up a basic Express.js server that listens for incoming HTTP requests on port 3000 and routes all requests starting with `/api` to a separate set of API routes defined in the `./routes/api` module.

## Functionality
1. The code imports the `express` module and creates a new Express application instance using `express()`.
2. It then imports the API routes defined in the `./routes/api` module.
3. The `app.use('/api', apiRoutes)` line tells Express to use the API routes for any requests that start with the `/api` path.
4. Finally, the `app.listen(3000, ...)` line starts the server and listens for incoming requests on port 3000. When a request is received, the callback function is executed, which logs a message to the console indicating that the server has started.

## Parameters and Return Values
- `express.require('express')`: This function returns the Express.js module, which is used to create the Express application instance.
- `express()`: This function creates a new Express application instance.
- `app.use(path, router)`: This method mounts the specified middleware function or router on the given path. In this case, it mounts the `apiRoutes` router on the `/api` path.
- `app.listen(port, callback)`: This method starts the server and listens for incoming requests on the specified port. The callback function is executed when the server starts listening.

## Example Usage
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const apiRoutes = require('./routes/api');

app.use('/api', apiRoutes);

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server started on port 3000'));
```

## Dependencies
This code has the following dependencies:
- `express`: The core Express.js framework, which is used to create the server and handle routing.
- `./routes/api`: A custom module that defines the API routes for the application.

### User.js

Here's the documentation for the provided JavaScript/TypeScript code:

# User Class

## Purpose
The `User` class represents a user entity, containing their name and email address.

## Functionality
The `User` class provides a way to create and manage user objects. It has the following features:

- **Constructor**: Initializes a new `User` instance with the provided `name` and `email` parameters.
- **Properties**: The `User` instance has two properties: `name` and `email`, which store the user's name and email address, respectively.

## Parameters and Return Values
### Constructor
- **Parameters**:
  - `name` (string): The name of the user.
  - `email` (string): The email address of the user.
- **Return Value**: A new `User` instance.

## Example Usage
```javascript
// Creating a new User instance
const user = new User('John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com');

console.log(user.name); // Output: 'John Doe'
console.log(user.email); // Output: 'johndoe@example.com'
```

## Dependencies
The `User` class is exported as a module, so it can be imported and used in other parts of the application. It does not have any external dependencies.

# User API Endpoint

## Purpose
This code sets up an Express.js router that provides a single endpoint for retrieving user information. The endpoint is located at the `/user` path and uses the `getUser` function from the `userController` module to handle the request.

## Functionality
The `getUser` function is responsible for retrieving user data and sending it as the response to the client. The implementation of this function is not provided in the given code, but it is expected to fetch user data from a data source (e.g., a database) and return it.

## Parameters and Return Values
The `getUser` function does not take any parameters, as the user information is likely identified by the authenticated user's session or some other mechanism.

The `getUser` function is expected to return an object or array representing the user data, which will be sent as the response to the client.

## Example Usage
To use this API endpoint, a client (e.g., a web application or a mobile app) can make a GET request to the `/user` path. The server will then execute the `getUser` function and send the user data back as the response.

Example request:
```
GET /user
```

Example response:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

## Dependencies
This code relies on the following dependencies:

1. **Express.js**: A popular web application framework for Node.js, used for setting up the server and routing.
2. **userController**: A module that exports the `getUser` function, which is responsible for fetching and returning user data.

To use this code, you will need to have Express.js installed in your project and implement the `getUser` function in the `userController` module.
